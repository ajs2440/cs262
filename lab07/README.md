Modified database to account for in progress monopoly games.
This was achieved by adding new fields to the PlayerGame table to record each player's current cash amount and piece location within each game.
A PlayerProperty table was also created to hold data related to the property each player owns within each game and how many houses and hotels exist in that property.
