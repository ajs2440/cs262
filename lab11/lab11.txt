Module changed: KeeperEditorScreen.js

Changes made:
- Changed all string to use singlequotes instead of doublequotes
- Fixed dangling commas
- Fixed semicolon issues so that the file doesn't use any

Changes not made:
- ESLint wanted to delete unused variables, but since this file is a work in progress, I chose not to do that
