This lab is based on https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/262/kvlinden/01introduction/lab.html

I simply had to update the text element to say "Hello, Expo!"

Answers to the lab questions:

- App.js is mainly concerned with how the application is supposed to perform and respond through the use of functions and the Javascript programming language. It looks like the default js file here also includes some CSS formatting to configure a basic app layout.

- package.json is a JavaScript Object Notation file which holds project data that is used for managing the project's dependencies, scripts, version,license data, configuration data, etc.

- node_modules stores locally the packages that are installed and it would be searched whenever a module is being used.

- .gitignore ignores any of the listed files or directories relative to its own location whenever updating changes
